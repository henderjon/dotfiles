No modifier at all means that the location is interpreted as a prefix. To
determine a match, the location will now be matched against the beginning of the
URI.

= The equal sign can be used if the location needs to match the exact request
URI. When this modifier is matched, the search stops right here.

~ Tilde means that this location will be interpreted as a case-sensitive RE
match.

~* Tilde followed by an asterisk modifier means that the location will be
processed as a case-insensitive RE match.

^~ Assuming this block is the best non-RE match, a carat followed by a tilde
modifier means that RE matching will not take place.
